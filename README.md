🌪️ AI-Powered Disaster Response & Alert System

A smart, real-time disaster management solution that uses AI, Machine Learning, location intelligence, and automated alerting to improve emergency response and reduce risk during natural calamities.

🚨 Key Features

Real-time Disaster Detection:
Utilizes AI/ML models and live data APIs (weather, seismic, satellite data) to identify potential disasters such as floods, earthquakes, storms, and fires.

Smart Alert System:
Sends instant SMS, email, and app-based notifications to users based on their geolocation and risk level.

User Location Tracking & Safety Status:
Tracks user location with permission, allows them to mark themselves Safe / Unsafe, and helps responders view affected zones.
